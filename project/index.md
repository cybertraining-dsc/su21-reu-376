## Abstract

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and programming machines to think like humans and mimic their actions. The proper concept definition of this term cannot be achieved simply by applying a mathematical, engineering, or logical approach but requires an approach that is linked to a deep cognitive scientific inquiry. THe use of machine-based learning is constantly evolving the dental and medical field to assist with medical decision making process.In addition to diagnosis of visually confirmed dental caries and impacted teeth, studies applying machine learning based on artificial neural networks to dental treatment through analysis of dental magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and cephalometric radiography are actively underway, and some visible results are emerging at a rapid pace for commercialization.

**Keywords:** Dentronics, neural pathways, prosthodotics. 

## 1. Introduction

 - [ ] Find literature about Dentronics and its effects
 - [ ] Analyze the literature


## 2. Data sets

- [ ] Find data sets about effects about dentronics
- [ ] Identify the purpose of data sets
- [ ] What are the challenges with Dentronics data sets? HIPPA, size, availibility
- [ ] Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in  GitHub. However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.



## 3. Using Images

- [ ] Place a cool image into projects images in my directory
- [ ] Correct the following, replace the fa number with my su number and the chart of png
- [ ] if image is copied , you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption
- [ ] list 

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 5. Example of an AI algorithm in Dentronics

- [ ] Identify the concrete data set that will be used
- [ ] Identify the concrete algorithm that is used to anaylze the data set
- [ ] Write the program
- [ ] Verify that it works

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 7. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

- [ ] Gregor helped me

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  

## 9. References

-[ ]  Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not                  just URLs. As we will at one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before the first square bracket.
