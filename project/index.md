## Abstract

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and programming machines to think like humans and mimic their actions. The proper concept definition of this term cannot be achieved simply by applying a mathematical, engineering, or logical approach but requires an approach that is linked to a deep cognitive scientific inquiry. THe use of machine-based learning is constantly evolving the dental and medical field to assist with medical decision making process.In addition to diagnosis of visually confirmed dental caries and impacted teeth, studies applying machine learning based on artificial neural networks to dental treatment through analysis of dental magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and cephalometric radiography are actively underway, and some visible results are emerging at a rapid pace for commercialization.

## 1. Introduction


Dental implants are  ribbed oral protheses typically made up of biocompatible titanium to replace the missing root(s) of an absent tooth. {1} These dental protheses are used to support the jaw bone to prevent deterioration due to an absent root. This is referred to as bone resorption which can result to facial malformation as well as reduced oral function such as biting and chewing. These devices are composed of three elements that imitates a natural tooth function and structure.The implant which are typically ribbed and threaded to promote stability while integrating within the bone tissue. The osseointegration process usually takes 6-8 months to rebuild the bone to support the implant. An implant abutment is fixed on top of the implant to act as a base for prosthetic devices. (2) Prefabricated abutments are manufactured in many shapes, sizes and angles depending on the location of the implant and the types of prothesis that will be attached. Dental abutments support a range of prothetic devices such as dental crowns, bridges, and dentures.

Osseointegrated dental implants depend on various factors that affect the anchorage of the  implant to the bone tissue. Successful surgical anchoring techniques can contribute to long term success of implant stability. Primary stability plays a role 2 week postoperatively by achieving mechanical retention of the implant.   It helps establish a mechanical microenvironment for gradual bone healing, or osseointegration-This is secondary implant stability. {2} Bone type, implant length, implant and diameter influences primary and secondary implant stability. Implant length can range from 6mm to 20mm; however, the most common lengths are between 8mm to 15mm. Many studies suggest that implant length contribute to decreasing bone stress and increasing implant stability. Bone stress can occur at both the cortical and cancellous part of the bone. Increasing implant length will decrease stress in the cancellous part of the bone while increasing the implant diameter can decrease  stress in the cortical part of the bone. Bone type can promote positive bone stimulation around an implant improving the overall function. There are four different types: Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV. Type I is the most dense of them which provides more cortical anchorage but has limited vascularity. Type II is the best for osseointegration because it provides good cortical anchorage and has better vascularity than type I. Type III and IV have a thin layer of cortical bone which decrease the success rate of primary stability{3).

Implant stability can be measured using the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) as an indirect indicator to determine the time frame for implant loading and prognostic indicator for implant failure(1). This can be measured by resonance frequency analysis (RFA) immediately after the implant has been  placed. Resonance frequency analysis is the measurement in which a device vibrates in response to frequencies in the range of 5-15 kHz. The peak amplitude of the response is then encoded into the implant stability quotient (ISQ) .The clinical range of ISQ is from 55-80. High stability is >70 ISQ while medium stability is between 60-69 ISQ. Low stability is <60 ISQ.(2) 

There are over 2000 types of  dental implant systems (DIS) that differs in diameter, length, shape, coating, and surface material properties. These devices have more than a 90% long termed survival rate which ranges more than 10 years. Inevitably, biological and mechanical complications such as fractures, low implant stability, and screw loosening can occur. Therefore, identifying the correct Dental Implant System is essential to repair or replace  the existing system. Methods and techniques that enables clear identification is insufficient.

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and programming machines to think like humans and mimic their actions. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is a brach of artificial intelligence that applies multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction, transformation, and classification of high dimensional datasets. Deep convolutional neural networks are commonly used to identify patterns in images and videos.  The structure typically consist of four types of layers: convolution, pooling, activation, and fully connected. These neural networks use images as an input to train a classifier which employs a mathematical operation called a convolution. Deep neural networks have been successfully applied in the dental field and demonstrated advantages in terms of diagnosis and prognosis.



## 2. Data sets

![Mean IT and Implant Stability Quotient](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybertraining-dsc/su21-reu-376/main/project/images/Mean-IT-and-implant-stability-quotient-ISQ-in-different-bone-types-Both-IT-and-ISQ.png)

- [ ] Find data sets about effects about dentronics
- [ ] Identify the purpose of data sets
- [ ] What are the challenges with Dentronics data sets? HIPPA, size, availibility
- [ ] Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in  GitHub. However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.



## 3. Using Images

- [ ] Place a cool image into projects images in my directory
- [ ] Correct the following, replace the fa number with my su number and the chart of png
- [ ] if image is copied , you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption
- [ ] list 

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 5. Example of an AI algorithm in Dentronics

- [ ] Identify the concrete data set that will be used
- [ ] Identify the concrete algorithm that is used to anaylze the data set
- [ ] Write the program
- [ ] Verify that it works

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 7. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

- [ ] Gregor helped me

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 9. References

- [ ]  Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not                  just URLs. As we will at one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before the first square bracket.
