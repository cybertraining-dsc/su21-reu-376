## Abstract

Here comes a short abstract of the project that summarizes what it is about

Contents

{{< table_of_contents >}}

{{% /pageinfo %}}

**Keywords:** Dentronics, neural pathways, prosthodotics. 

## 1. Introduction

 - [ ] Find literature about Dentronics and its effects
 - [ ] Analyze the literature


## 2. Data sets

- [ ] Find data sets about effects about dentronics
- [ ] Identify the purpose of data sets
- [ ] What are the challenges with Dentronics data sets? HIPPA, size, availibility
- [ ] Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in  GitHub. However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.



## 3. Using Images

- [ ] Place a cool image into projects images in my directory
- [ ] Correct the following, replace the fa number with my su number and the chart of png
- [ ] if image is copied , you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption
- [ ] list 

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 5. Example of an AI algorithm in Dentronics

- [ ] Identify the concrete data set that will be used
- [ ] Identify the concrete algorithm that is used to anaylze the data set
- [ ] Write the program
- [ ] Verify that it works

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 7. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

- [ ] Gregor helped me

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  

## 9. References

-[ ]  Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not                  just URLs. As we will at one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before the first square bracket.
